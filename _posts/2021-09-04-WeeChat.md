I remember quiet well being on IRC all day long after school when I was a kid and we finally had internet access. As we have been running Windows ME or something like that, the obvious choice was [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com) back then.

Recently I stumbled across [WeeChat](https://weechat.org), which is an IRC-client for the command line. Running WeeChat in a tmux-session on a cloud machine is really handy, to avoid missing something ðŸ˜€. See [[Cloud Free Tier]]

## How to install
As simple as it could be (on Ubuntu 20.04):
```
$ apt install weechat
```

### Some hotkeys (aka key bindings), which are useful:

Action | Hotkey
----|---
switch channels | ``ALT+Arrows``
