Since over a year I'm highly into note-taking and creating a personal knowledge graph which can help me retrieve information and let the creativity flow.
This includes all kind of stuff e.g. relationships, technical things, processes etc.

I often came across the idea to share this knowledge and help others (besides me) to use the collected bits and bytes. So this will be my new main website.

Let's see how this will work.
