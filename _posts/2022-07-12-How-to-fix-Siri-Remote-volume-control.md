Recently the Siri Remote got an over the air update from Apple TV 4K.
The version is indicated on Apple TV > Settings > Remote > .. Version 0x0070.

Since then the volume control (louder, quieter, mute) was not working anymore.
I guess thats happened due to changes in the HDMI connection protocol or something.

To fix this 
- disconnect TV & Apple TV from power
- disconnect the HDMI **(required)**
- wait for few minutes ☕️
- connect HDMI
- power on

The fixes at [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205225) did not help.
