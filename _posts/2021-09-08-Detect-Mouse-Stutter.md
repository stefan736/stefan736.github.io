I recently bought a [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/de-de/products/mice/mx-master-3-mac-wireless-mouse.910-005696.html?crid=7) mouse, which is bluetooth connected and should be one of the best... ofcourse. The idea was to make it more comfortable moving from home-office to office.

Turns out, it lags on the Macbook Air with Apple Silicon M1, macOS 11.5.2. Maybe on all M1s.

If you also have that feeling you can easily visualize that moving your mouse on  [vsynctester.com](https://www.vsynctester.com/testing/mouse.html)

Good thing is, I will mostly use the mouse on Windows which should be no problem... testing tomorrow => works perfectly fine

P.S.: This should be also fixed on macOS 12, the rumors says...
