Some years ago after having used really thin keyboards I moved to a mechanical keyboard again, which is so much nicer to type on.

[Keychron K2v2](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard), also available with [german layout](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-german-iso-de-layout)

### Shortcuts
See on the official website [keychron.com](https://www.keychron.com/blogs/news/keychron-keyboards-shortcuts-introduction)

What the documentation does not tell you is how to check the battery life! But I will:

**Just press `Fn+B` and look how many rows on your keyboard light up.**
