Nowadays there a plenty of cloud-providers out there offering a bunch of services.
If you want to try these or even use them regulary for free, I have something for you.

I will just cover VMs here, but feel free to look also at other services.

## AWS
Offers some services 12 months free of charge.
I will not go into detail because sadly this is not ALWAYS free. But have a look at [https://aws.amazon.com/free/](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

### Cloud Providers with ALWAYS free tier
Cloud Provider | # VMs | vCPUs / VM | Memory |¬†Disk |¬†Outgoing Traffic
--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: 
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/free/) | 1 | 2 | 1 GB | 30 GB | 1 GB
[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) | 1 | 1 | 1 GB | 64 GB | 15 GB
[Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) | **2**<br />**1** | 2<br />4 (ARM) | 1 GB<br />24 GB | 200 GB<br /> | 10 TB

Oracle is my favourite choice here  üòç 

If you set this is up using an Ubuntu image, it can be that the firewall is enabled.
