Hi, I'm Stefan.

I started my software carreer early on as a kid programming and selling windows applications for Dial-Up modem monitoring.
Working as an web-programmer and administrator and later building up the Facebook alternative StudiVZ I had the urge to learn more.
I studied IT-Systems-Engineering at the [Hasso-Plattner-Institut](https://hpi.de) in Postdam, Germany.
This let me to [Smalltalk-lang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) which is one of the first OO- and most beautiful and easy to learn programming languages...(I miss that sometimes).
After designing Cloud Architectures, defining and establishing processes including a lot of automation (yeeah GitOps!) at [COLLENDA GmbH](https://collenda.com/de-en) I'm now really happy to be part of the [International IT of ALDI South](https://it-jobs.aldi-sued.de/en/)  ensuring your shopping experience is always smooth around the globe. 

I hold the certifications:
- [The Linux Foundation Certified Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/6980b2d7-aa8b-4b58-b4a6-7db37c8df8a7/public_url)
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate](https://is.gd/P5GOBC)

I'm member and/or supporter of 
- [European Smalltalk User Group](http://www.esug.org)
- [Chaos Computer Club](https://ccc.de/en)
- [Tor](https://www.torproject.org)
- [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org)
